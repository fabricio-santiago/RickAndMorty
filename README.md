# Rick and Morty App

This project was created to reinforce knowledge in Kotlin + Compose, using a free API about the series Rick and Morty

I utilized Jetpack Compose in this project and followed the best practices to developer the app's behaviors.

## LocationsScreen

- List all locations with infinite scroll and increasing the page parameter.
